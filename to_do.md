ASK HN:  Live Hackathon!  Creating Online Markdown Editor for API documentation.  

Hello,

Hi guys,

We are a San Diego based startup that is doing a hackathon this weekend.  We are working on an internal project to publish and maintain documentation without any software installation.  Over the next 2 days we are doing an internal hackathon to celebrate a co-founder's birthday.  We would love to get your feedback.

Check out the description of the hackathon project here: http://www.onlinemarkdowneditor.com/docs/tbrianjones/ome-docs/DOCUMENTATION.md

Help us decide which of these potential features we should implement over the next 48hrs.  http://www.onlinemarkdowneditor.com/docs/tbrianjones/ome-docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#feature-ideas

This is a LIVE HACKATHON, so we'd love it if you can pop into the chatroom to learn about how you use documentations.
