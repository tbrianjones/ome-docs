The Online Markdown Editor (OME) is a convenient way to maintain and display your documentation on the web.

It is being developed in a live hackathon, 10/17/2013 - 10/19/2013.

Please see the User/Repository#Num: leleu/ome-docs/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md file for a demo and more information.

Please visit [the live hackathon chat](http://tlk.io/ii_hackathon) to give us feedback, ask questions, or just talk with us while we're doing the hackathon.
